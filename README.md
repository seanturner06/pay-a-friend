# Pay-A-Friend 💸

**Pay-A-Friend** is a prototype peer-to-peer payment interface built to simulate the experience of sending and receiving money between users. While it mimics the flow of a real payment app, it is not connected to any financial APIs and does not currently store data in a database.


## Demo Coming Soon....
